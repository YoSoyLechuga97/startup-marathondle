      <!--Explain the rules of Marathondle -->
      <p>
        Marathondle is a play off of the popular game 'Wordle' designed to see how far you can go before getting stumped. Every word is a five-letter word randomly selected and you will be able to submit 6 guesses to determine what the word is. After each guess you will be given one of three hints for each letter:
      </p>
      <li>Green: The letter is correct and in the correct space</li>
      <li>Yellow: The letter is correct but in the wrong space</li>
      <li>Grey: The letter is not in the word (incorrect)</li>
      <p>
        If you are able to figure out the word you will recieve points and will be given a fresh word and board-once you lose your score will be saved. Add friends to your profile and see who has the best vocabulary!

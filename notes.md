This is my notes page for CS260!

FIRST OFF: Make sure to push at the end of every assignment, not just commit.

I have officially started my server through AWS

IP addresses allow me to log into the website from an http://
My personal website is at http://100.26.112.80/
I can ssh into it with my .pem key (located currently on my laptop and in my private ssh)
From the ssh there are files I can access and manipulate.

I have relearned a great deal about html!
To start: it really is just a mark-up language. Theres not much in terms of coding happening, rather we are just making detailed claimes about types of text and how we want it to be approached and designed, honestly so far it makes a whole lot of sense! Everything is divided by calling it ie <div> or something like that, and then closing it ie </div>.

I am beginning to learn about JavaScript, here's a few key things that I have learned right from the start:
<ul>
  <li>Unlike C++ and other languages you do not need to declare the variable type right off the bat, though it probably is good practice to.</li>
  <li>Array's have a ton of static functions that make them very useful</li>
  <li>A great deal of javascript gets sent to the <strong>console</strong>, it's like the terminal of other coding where we can read output from the code</li>
</ul>

This is my notes page for CS260!

FIRST OFF: Make sure to push at the end of every assignment, not just commit.

I have officially started my server through AWS

IP addresses allow me to log into the website from an http://
My personal website is at http://100.26.112.80/
I can ssh into it with my .pem key (located currently on my laptop and in my private ssh)
From the ssh there are files I can access and manipulate.

Theres not much in terms of coding happening, rather we are just making detailed claimes about types of text and how we want it to be approached and designed, honestly so far it makes a whole lot of sense! Everything is divided by calling it ie <div> or something like that, and then closing it ie </div>.
